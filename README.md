# Post-Quantum Searchable Encryption on Cloud Storage using Lattice-Based Cryptography

This repository contains a research project focused on developing a post-quantum searchable encryption scheme for cloud storage using Lattice-Based Cryptography. The project addresses the challenge of securing cloud data in a post-quantum world, where classical cryptographic methods may no longer be effective.

Overview
To tackle this problem, we conducted an analysis of various solutions by reviewing multiple research papers and completing a survey on the current approaches. The project report explores existing methods and identifies potential future research directions to address the remaining challenges in this field.

Report Language
The project report has been written in Persian and was prepared for my professor. If you are interested in discussing the results or learning more about the project, feel free to reach out via email.
